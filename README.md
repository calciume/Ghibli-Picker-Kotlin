### Studio Ghibli Picker: Kotlin Edition by calciume

I wrote this same program in [Python](https://github.com/calciume/Ghibli-Picker) 2 years ago but this is a pretty good programming exercise so I decided to write it again in Kotlin to get myself familiar with the language. 

As someone who is still basically a total beginner in programming writing this was actually quite tough because I actually had to work with scopes, I couldn't just make global variables any time I am inconvenienced by scopes. 

**How to run (Unix-like OS's)**
1. `git clone https://github.com/calciume/Ghibli-Picker-Kotlin`
2. `cd Ghibli-Picker-Kotlin`
3. `kotlinc src/main/kotlin/Main.kt -include-runtime -d Ghibli-Picker-Kotlin.jar`
4. `java -jar Ghibli-Picker-Kotlin.jar`
